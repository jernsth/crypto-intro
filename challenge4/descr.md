# If you are ever stuck at a problem...

We have been able to intercept a message, which we would like to decode. Luckily, our team was not only able to retrieve the message but also the function, that checks the access.

The encrypted flag is stored in 'flag.enc' and the extracted code is stored in 'decrypt.py'.

Can you recover the flag?

**Hint**: Take a good look at the properties of cryptographic hash-functions.

Good luck!
