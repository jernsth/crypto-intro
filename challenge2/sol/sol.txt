Plain:     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
Cipher:    Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M

The above table shows the substitution cipher used to encrypt the text. Revert it and you get the following text:

"The art of cryptography has shaped the history of the world. From the earliest civilizations to modern times, the need to protect information has driven innovation. The key to the puzzle is pwn. The most basic ciphers may hide the truth, but with the right knowledge, the code can be broken. Understanding the patterns in the letters is often the key to revealing the original message."

Now take the key of the text ('pwn') and decrypt the flag with the vigenere cipher and you get the original flag.
