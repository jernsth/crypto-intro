**Challenge Title:** *The Art of Encryption*

**Description:**

> During a recent operation, we were able to intercept a cryptic message. Unfortunately, the message is completely unreadable to us due to the encryption it employs. Our experts suspect it has been encoded using an ancient and widely-used cipher, but the exact method remains unknown.  
>  
> We've managed to extract the encrypted message (cipher.txt), but it is still a mystery. The message is believed to contain valuable information, possibly a code or a secret instruction, but we need someone with a sharp mind to crack it.  
> 
> Can you decrypt the ciphertext and get the key?
> 
> Good luck!
> 
>**1. Hint** Which letter does appear most often in the english language?
>**2. Hint** The caesar cipher is, slightly twisted, used in other historic ciphers.
