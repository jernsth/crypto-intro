# XOR: The Key to the Flag

During a recent network forensics operation, we intercepted what appears to be an encrypted message. Analysts suspect it was encrypted using a simple XOR cipher.

The encrypted flag is stored in `flag.enc`, and we were able to extract the key used in the process.

Recover the original flag using the provided key.

**Hint** Take a good look on how xor is working!

Good luck!
